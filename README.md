# Dice-Roll-Battle
For this game, it is a turn-based game. There are 2 players where each player rolls two virtual dice in their turn. If the sum of their two dice roll is odd, they will gain the points as the sum of the two dices. If the sum is even, they will lose 3 points (there is no negative points, minimum is 0). The live scroe will be shown after every round. The first player to reach 30 points wins the game.
